**Definition of Cybersecurity**

Cyber security is the practice to defend internet-connected systems, such as hardware, software, programs, and data from damage, malicious attacks, or unauthorized access. It helps prevent cybercriminals from gaining access to data, systems, or networks. Cyber security is a broad subject that includes many security mechanisms, such as data security, ethical hacking, and digital forensics.

Cyber security can be categorized into the following:

* Application Security
    
* Cloud Security
    
* Data Security
    
* Endpoint Security
    
* Information Security
    
* Identity Management
    
* Mobile Security
    
* Network Security
    

With cyber threats continuing to evolve globally, every organization especially those involved in safeguarding sensitive data needs to take appropriate steps to protect their sensitive information.

**Definition of Ethical Hacking**

Ethical hacking is a subset of cybersecurity. It refers to the process of testing the system against potential security breaches or data threats and repairing the flaws before any cyber attack happens. Ethical hacking involves finding vulnerabilities and weak points that cybercriminals can exploit.

Ethical hackers are also known as white-hat hackers. White hat hackers work similar to black-hat hackers but with a different intent. White hat hackers use their skills to find the loopholes of the given system with permission from the server/system admin. They do not want to harm anyone with their acts rather they safeguard the systems.
